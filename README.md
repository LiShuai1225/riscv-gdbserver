# riscv-gdbserver
GDB Server for interacting with RISC-V models, boards and FPGAs

## Status
The key files are being added, but autoconf, etc has not yet been run. Do not attempt
to use this yet.

## Notes on building
At the present time, the build system assumes that you have cloned the picorv32 repository
from github.com/embecosm/picorv32 into the root of this repo.

## Notes on documentation
Since this is being developed from the ground-up, it does not yet have a doc directory.
It will be added, and populated with useful documentation, at the appropriate time.
